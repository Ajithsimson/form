       <p style="color: green;">Ignorant people are destroying this world. All suffering in this world is caused by ignorant people. Wars, poverty, diseases, corruption, inequality, crime, inflation, etc. – things don’t just happen. Bad things happen due to mistakes and carelessness. And the root trigger of all mistakes and carelessness is an unwillingness to enhance the mind.</p>
